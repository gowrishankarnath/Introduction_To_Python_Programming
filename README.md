### Book Details  
**Hardcover:** 464 pages  
**Publisher:** Chapman and Hall/CRC Press; 1 edition (November 7, 2018)

**ISBN-10:** 0815394373   
**ISBN-13:** 978-0815394372   

### Software Requirements
All the code in the book works with Python 3.6 version or above. Since _**f**_-strings are used throughout the book which was introduced in Python 3.6 version, you need to have Python interpreter 3.6 or above for the code to work as it is. Install the latest version of 64-bit Anaconda Distribution with support for Python 3.6 or above. If you want to make the code work with Python 3.1 to 3.5 versions, use str.format() statements within the print() function instead of f-strings. The rest of the statements within the code remains the same and the code should work fine. It is highly recommended that you use the latest version of PyCharm Community Edition to execute the programs. You will gain valuable insights in to Python programming language by using this IDE, no matter whether you are a beginner or an experienced professional.  

### Book Source Code  
You need to download the folder [Book_Code](/Book_Code) and open it in PyCharm IDE. Each of the code files are numbered and they appear under a Chapter number. The numbering of the code files corresponds to the order in which they appear in the book. Each of the code file is a self-contained file. To run a code file, right-click on the file name in the PyCharm IDE and select the "Run" from the context menu.

### Who Should Read This Book?
This book is for beginners to Python programming who are interested in learning the basics of Python programming language.
